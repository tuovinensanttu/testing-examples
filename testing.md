### Advantages of testing

- Code covered with tests is more reliable than code without tests
- Bugs are found easily and quicker
- Allows quick changes to code
- Allows code refactoring
- Product quality is better when we can be sure it works
- Developers can also re-use the code, migrating it to new project

### Unit testing
- Unit testing is the process of checking small pieces of code to ensure that the individual parts of the program work properly on their own, speeding testing and strategies and reducing wasted test. 

### End to end testing
- E2E testing is a technique that tests application's workflow from beginning to end to make sure everything functions as expected


### Smoke Testing
- This type of software testing validates the stability of a software application, it is performed on the initial software build to ensure that the critical functions of the program are working. 


### Mocking
- Mocking means creating a face version of and external or internal service that can stand in for the real one, helping your tests run more quickly and more reliably.

### TDD - Test Driven Development
- In a nutshell - in no means full explanation about TDD methodology
- Normally when developing a new feature, the actual code is written first and after that tests
- In TDD this process is reversed
- Test cases are implemented first and then the actual feature
- The idea is to write only as much code that is needed for all the test cases to pass




JIRA ticket
- Add user enpoint

- Endpoint is ready

- We want make sure the enpoint is reachable
- We can test the validars 
- Database can save the user data
